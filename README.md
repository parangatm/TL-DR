# TL;DR - An attempt to write more

A place to share my thoughts on the articles I come across in an attempt to write more myself, and depend less on ChatGPT for generating content.
Thanks to targeted social media, I come across so many new research and developments, and it feels a waste to just bookmark them for future. Hope this repository helpful to people learn about new ideas.
